Implemented CRUD operations for Chuck Norris facts with a PHP api

API endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating and deleting Chuck Norris facts.

Utilized PDO (PHP Data Objects) to interact with MySQL database.

Included proper error handling using try/catch blocks and http error codes (200/400/500/...)

Improved code readability by separating 
- functions into "functions.php" file
- endpoints to "api.php"
- database connection into "connexionDB.php"

chuckapi_alwaysdata_js is a beta version using an existant api and database server (only html/js/css data manipulation)

chuckapietu/v1 / v2 / v3 /... are self-made api codes in php with database manipulation to implements CRUD operations.
