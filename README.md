Implemented CRUD operations for Chuck Norris facts with a PHP api

API endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating and deleting Chuck Norris facts.
Utilized PDO (PHP Data Objects) to interact with MySQL database.
Included proper error handling using try/catch blocks and http error codes (200/400/500/...)
Improved code readability by separating 
- functions into "functions.php" file
- endpoints to "api.php"
- database connection into "connexionDB.php"
